## FeedMe
Get food delivered with one command!

This python program allows you to place delivery or carryout orders at your favorite restaurants/pizza places/sandwich shops with a single command. Addresses, payment information, and orders can all be saved to keep the command slim. For example, you might save an order for Papa John's as 'papafavorite'--to place that same order again, the following is all you need to type: 
```
$ feedme papafavorite
```
How easy!

FeedMe is built using selenium webscrapers, and a custom webscraper must be built for every site that FeedMe supports. I will attempt to produce as many of these scrapers as possible, but help is always appreciated. This project is meant to be scalable, and more scrapers for more sites will help immensely.
